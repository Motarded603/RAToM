# RAToM - Repository of Admin Tools on the Move

**RAToM** is an Electron-based application that helps system administrators manage and execute PowerShell scripts efficiently. With a clean interface built using React, RAToM allows users to view PowerShell scripts, execute them, and access their output in real-time.

## Features
- Sync/Download Scripts via Github repos.
- View scripts along with any outputs based on metadata in script.
  - Ability to add custom metadata for custom scripts.
- Execute PowerShell scripts with optional parameters.
- View script output and error messages in a console.
- Designed to run as standalone or installation.

## Prerequisites
- PowerShell must be available on your machine (for script execution).

## Script Metadata Requirements
RAToM displays scripts in the GUI via *metadata* appended at the top of the file.

For PowerShell scripts, the app utilizes *PS1 metadata*. A PowerShell script should include the following at the top of the file using JSON format:
```json
<#
.NOTES
{
    "metadata": {}
}
#>
```

There are two metadata JSON files the app utilizes (located in .\ratom\resources\scripts\).
- *scripts-metadata.json*: this file is generated by the app, grabbing metadata from script files themselves
- *custom-metadata.json*: enable option in settings menu, this is user-generated metadata for custom scripts


*custom-metadata.json* should follow the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "author": "[insert author]",
        "date": "[insert date]",
        "version": "[insert version]",
        "name": "[insert name]",
        "description": "[insert description]",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "name": "[insert param name]",
                "description": "[insert param description]",
                "example": "[insert example data for field]"
            }
        ],
        "examples": [
            {
                "command": "[insert example command usage]",
                "description": "[insert example description]"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
